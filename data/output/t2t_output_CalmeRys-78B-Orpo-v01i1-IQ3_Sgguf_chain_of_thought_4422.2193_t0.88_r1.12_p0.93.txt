 I'll analyze the provided blood test results by identifying molecules that are outside the normal ranges:

- **Creatine Kinase (CPK)**: The detected level is 217, which is above the normal range of 45-155. This indicates a "High" reading. Elevated CPK can be associated with muscle damage or disease, as the enzyme is found in muscle tissues and released into the bloodstream when these tissues are damaged.
- **Aspartate Aminotransferase (ALT)**: The detected level is 83, which exceeds the normal range of 10-60. This is considered "High", potentially indicating liver or muscle disease since ALT is released when these tissues are damaged.
- **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)**: The detected level is 2780, which is significantly higher than the normal range of 45-152. This is a "High" reading, and significantly elevated ALP can point to liver disease, bone disorders, or endocrine issues.
- **Trigliceridi**: The detected level is 158, which is above the normal range of 30-95. This is considered "High". Elevated triglycerides can indicate metabolic or dietary issues and are often seen in conjunction with other lipid imbalances.
- **Alanine Aminotransferase (AST)**: The detected level is 36, which is actually within the normal range of 10-45. No abnormality here.
- **Bilirubina Total**: The detected level is 0.10, which is within the normal range of 0.10-0.44. No abnormality here.
- **Protein Total**: The detected level is 7.2, which is within the normal range of 5.8-8.0. No abnormality here.
- **Albumine**: The detected level is 3.26, which is within the normal range of 2.6-3.8. No abnormality here.
- **Globuline**: The detected level is 3.90, which is within the normal range of 2.6-4.5. No abnormality here.
- **Rapp. Alb/Glob**: The detected level is 0.84, which is within the normal range of 0.84-1.91. No abnormality here.
- **Colesterolo**: The detected level is 201, which is within the normal range of 120-300. No abnormality here.
- **Amilasi**: The detected level is 836, which is within the normal range of 200-1900. No abnormality here.
- **Lipasi**: The detected level is 64, which is within the normal range of 10-350. No abnormality here.
- **UREA**: The detected level is 21, which is within the normal range of 15-45. No abnormality here.
- **CREA**: The detected level is 0.69, which is within the normal range of 0.60-1.80. No abnormality here.
- **Glucosio**: The detected level is 88, which is within the normal range of 70-110. No abnormality here.
- **Calcio**: The detected level is 9.80, which is within the normal range of 8.0-12.0. No abnormality here.
- **Acido Urico**: The detected level is 0.2, which is within the normal range of 0.2-1. No abnormality here.
- **Fosforo**: The detected level is 3.90, which is within the normal range of 2.5-5.6. No abnormality here.
- **Sodio**: The detected level is 150, which is within the normal range of 144-155. No abnormality here.
- **Potassio**: The detected Level is 4.9, which is within the normal range of 3.3-5.4. No abnormality here.
- **Rapp. Na/K**: The detected level is 30.61, which is within the normal range of >27. No abnormality here.
- **Magnesio**: The detected Level is 111, but the correct measurement unit should be mg/dl, and the range 1.60-2.48. This is considered "High". Misinterpretation of unit may lead to false conclusions. 
- **Calcio Iónico**: The detected level is 1.50, which is above the normal range of 0.97-1.34. This can be a "High" reading. Elevated ionized calcium can indicate conditions such as hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, or diseases affecting bone metabolism.
- **Cloro corrispondente**: The detected level is 108.04, which is within the normal range of 98.0-118. No abnormality here.
- **HCO3**: The detected level is 21, which is within the normal range of 17.0-25.2. No abnormality here.
- **Div. anionico**: The detected level is 23, which is within the normal range of 12.0-24.0. No abnormality here.
- **Osmolarità cal.**: The detected level is 322, which is within the normal range of 314-335. No abnormality here.
- **Ferro**: The detected level is 114, which is within the normal range of 100-280. No abnormality here.
- **UBC**: The detected level is 330, which is within the normal range of 150-350. No abnormality here.
- **TIBC**: The detected level is 444, which is within the normal range of 300-510. No abnormality here.
- **Saturazione**: The detected level is 25.68, which is below the normal range of 30-60. This is a "Low" reading. Low iron saturation could be an indicator of iron deficiency or ineffective erythropoiesis.
- **Ferritina**: The detected level is 21, which is within the normal range of 20-78. No abnormality here.
- **Aptoglobina HPT**: The detected level is 20, but the correct reading should be 60 - 9, since Haptoglobin levels are typically measured in mg/dl, suggesting a potential "Low" reading, but due to a possible confusion in the interpretation of this result, it is unclear without further context. 
- **Ac. Billari pre**: The detected level is 0.3, which is below the normal range of 0.6-30. This is a "Low" reading. Low pre-bilirubin levels are typically not concerning as they can be a result of physiological variability or test specificity.
- **Ac. Billari post**: The detected level is 0.6, which is within the normal range of 0.6-30. No abnormality here.
- **Alpha 2 Macroglobulina**: The detected level is 0.02, which is below the normal range of 0.65-398, suggesting a "Low" reading. This might be due to data misinterpretation or a test anomaly, as the range seems to be incorrectly formatted.
- **Cistatina**: The detected level is 2282, which is below the normal range of 3350-6550, suggesting a "Low" reading, again potential misinterpretation due to unusual scale or unit.
- **Coleinesterasi**: The detected level is 30, which is below the normal range of 188-351. This is considered "Low", Coleinesterase levels are not typically a standard part of a routine veterinary panel, and this could indicate neurological issues or liver dysfunction.
- **LDH**: The detected level is 188, which is below the normal range of 351-398. This is considered "Low", this discrepancy could be due to incorrect values or range, as LDH is an enzyme typically seen elevated in cases of cell damage.
- **Fruttosamina**: The detected level is 0.2, which is within the normal range of 0.2-1. No abnormality here.
- **Lattato**: The detected level is 4.95, which is above the normal range of 0.01-9.0. This is "High". Elevated lactic acid could indicate issues such as anoxia, shock, or metabolic disorders.
- **Ceruloplasmina**: The detected level is 2.5, which is above the normal range of 0.01-0.10. This is a "High" reading. Ceruloplasmin is an acute phase reactant, increased levels may suggest inflammation, infection, or other diseases.
- **Proteina C Reatt.**: The detected level is 0.01, which is below the normal range of 0.10-4.95. This is "Low". Low CRP is generally not a concern as it signifies a lack of inflammation.
- **AGP**: The detected Level is 0.01, which is below the normal range of 0.10-4.95. This is "Low". AGP is an acute phase protein, low levels are not typically concerning.
- **Other Molecules**: The remaining molecules provided seem to have incorrectly formatted data or units, making it challenging to assess their normalcy.

- **Summary**: The dog may be experiencing muscle damage or disease indicated by elevated Creatine Kinase (CPK). The high ALT and ALP levels suggest potential liver disease or bone disorders, while triglyceride levels may indicate metabolic issues. Low Magnesio (when correctly measured), Cistatina, and Saturazione readings could point to nutritional or metabolic problems. The high lactic acid could also be an indication of anaerobic metabolism due to shock or metabolic issues. The "Low" readings of Alpha 2 Macroglobulina, LDH, and Coleinesterasi suggest potential misinterpretation errors due to unusual or incorrectly formatted data. The remaining results are normal or potential misreadings due to unclear data presentation. It's advisable to review and clarify certain results due to unclear data or unit representation.

        It's crucial to note that the interpretation of blood tests in veterinary medicine should always be done in conjunction with clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, and potentially additional diagnostic tests. The discrepancies in this analysis could be due to errors in data presentation, unit misinterpretation, or actual abnormalities. For "High" and "Low" readings, a re-check or clarification with the lab might be needed.  <|eot_id|>
