      "**Platelets (PLT) ‚Äì Status: Low**\n",

      "  - **Potential Causes:**\n",
      "    - **Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia (IMT):** The immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets, leading to a low count.\n",
      "    - **Hypersplenism:** An enlarged spleen can remove more platelets from the circulation than normal.\n",
      "    - **Bone Marrow Disorders:** Conditions that affect bone marrow function can lead to reduced platelet production.\n",
